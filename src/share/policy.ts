/**
 * What a share-link guest is allowed to reach — the capability policy.
 *
 * ── Why this file is an ALLOWLIST ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every other principal in RepoYeti is the owner, so the auth gate has only ever had to answer
 * "is this the owner?" (auth.ts authMiddleware). A share link introduces a second, strictly-lesser
 * principal, and the failure mode we must design against is not "a guest slips past the gate" —
 * it's "someone adds a route in six months and never thinks about guests at all". A DENYLIST leaks
 * by default in exactly that case. So: anything not named here is OWNER-ONLY, full stop, and
 * `tests/share-policy.test.ts` walks the live Hono routing table to force every new route to be
 * classified consciously (see OWNER_ONLY below).
 *
 * ── Why the table is keyed by route PATTERN, matched here ───────────────────────
 * The gate runs as `app.use("/api/*", ...)`, where Hono has not yet matched a route — `c.req.
 * routePath` is the middleware's own "/api/*", not "/api/repos/:id/pull". So this module does its
 * own matching, compiling each pattern once at load. That is a feature, not a workaround: the
 * middleware is the ONE chokepoint every request crosses. There is no equivalent chokepoint deeper
 * in the stack — `db.getRepo(id)` takes only an id and knows nothing about the caller, and routes
 * reach it three inconsistent ways (respond.ts's withRepo/action helpers, a second lookup inside
 * the service layer, and two hand-rolled inline lookups in tags.ts and files.ts that bypass the
 * helpers entirely). Enforcing scope anywhere but here would silently miss those.
 *
 * ── Do NOT key this off openapi.ts's META ──────────────────────────────────────
 * It looks like the obvious registry, but it is NOT exhaustive: buildOpenApiDoc() emits a fallback
 * entry for any route missing from META, so its drift guard passes while META silently lacks
 * ~11 real routes (/api/repos/cleanup-missing, /api/repos/:id/move, /api/settings/sync, …).
 * Enumerate `app.routes` — the live truth — as the drift guard does.
