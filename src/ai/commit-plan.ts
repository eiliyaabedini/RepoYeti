// ── commit plan: split a working tree into multiple logical commits ────────────────
//
// "Smart commit": instead of one stage-all commit, the model partitions the changed FILES
// into several scoped commits, each with its own message. File-level only (a file is never
// split across commits) — see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §14 (Smart Commit) for why (the safety invariant). The plan
// is a SUGGESTION: the daemon validates it, the owner edits it, and a separate call commits.
