 * generated (Groq answers "Limit 12000, Requested 12994" instantly — "Requested" is input +
 * max_tokens). A rejected plan degrades to the heuristic bucket-split, which is strictly worse
 * than a slightly shorter body, so this stays deliberately conservative.
 *
 * Left at 4096 on purpose. Raising it was the obvious move for terse bodies and the wrong one:
 * measured on the live free tier this targets, `x-ratelimit-limit-tokens` is 12000/min, and the
 * ceiling only binds at ~35+ files (conventional) — trees whose diffs are already near the

 * the model to PREFER more, smaller commits, so the harder it obeys, the more groups share the
 * same file-derived budget: a 14-file tree split 7 ways got ~157 tokens/group, and after the JSON
 * skeleton, subject, `files` array and rationale (~90-110) that left ~45-65 for the body. A body
 * worth reading does not fit in 45 tokens, so the prompt and the ceiling were fighting each other.
 *
 * Sizing rule: G <= N always, so the worst case rule 2 can produce is one commit per file. Setting
 * the rate at roughly ONE BODY'S WORTH per file keeps that worst case affordable, which makes any
