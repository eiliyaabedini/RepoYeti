RepoYeti runs a small daemon on your machine, finds every git repo you have, and serves a dashboard to your phone over a private tunnel. Fetch, commit, push, and read history and diffs from wherever you are. It runs on your machine, so your code stays there.

## What you get

- 📡 &nbsp;**Live repo grid.** Branch / dirty / ahead / behind for every repo, updated the moment it changes. Fetch all in one tap.
- 🌿 &nbsp;**Git-graph history.** The commit graph with lanes and merges, lazily paged, with each commit's files-and-lines delta.
- ☑️ &nbsp;**Bulk actions.** Select any number of repos and pin, star, hide or remove them in one go. Every action undoes.
- 👀 &nbsp;**Preview a pull.** See the incoming commits, the files they touch, and any conflicts they'd cause, before you pull. Nothing is fetched or merged by looking.
- 🔍 &nbsp;**Monaco diffs.** The real VS Code editor: syntax highlighting, HEAD-↔-tree diffs, edit and save.
- 🤖 &nbsp;**Smart Commit (AI).** Split a messy working tree into clean, scoped commits. Connect an AI Pass account or bring your own key.
- 🪪 &nbsp;**Per-repo identities.** The right git identity for each repo, no `--amend --author` afterthoughts.
- 🏠 &nbsp;**Self-hosted.** Nothing runs in someone else's cloud. Uninstall it and your repos are untouched.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LunarWerxs/RepoYeti.git
cd repoyeti && bun install
bun run src/index.ts add-root ~/code   # point it at where your repos live
bun run src/index.ts start             # daemon on 127.0.0.1:7171
```

To reach it from your phone (opens a Cloudflare tunnel and prints a QR code):

```sh
bun run src/index.ts start --tunnel
```

Prefer a single binary? Grab one from [Releases](https://github.com/LunarWerxs/RepoYeti/releases).

## AI setup: connect an account or bring your own key

Smart Commit and AI commit messages are optional. A first-party build can use **Settings → AI →
Connect AI Pass**: RepoYeti uses the connected account's shared wallet, so there is no API key to
create or paste. OAuth tokens stay in the machine's native credential store and AI requests leave
the browser through the local daemon.

The existing bring-your-own-key providers remain available. Groq is the suggested provider: free,
fast, and about 30 seconds to set up:

1. Open **[console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)** and sign in.
2. Click **Create API Key**, then **Copy**.
3. In the app, open **Settings → AI**, expand **Groq**, and paste it in.

"Generate" lights up right away. Prefer OpenAI / Claude / Gemini / OpenRouter / DeepSeek? Add that
key in the same place instead; your key never leaves the daemon (it's kept in your OS keychain).

## The rules

No force-push, no `reset --hard`, no rebase. A phone is a lousy place to rewrite history, so those live at your desk. Pulls are fast-forward-only, and everything runs as the git identity you set for that repo. Local state stays in `~/.repoyeti/`; nothing is written into your repos.

## Built with

Bun · `bun:sqlite` · Hono · `simple-git` on the daemon, and a Vue 3 + Tailwind PWA on the front end. Sign-in is "Sign in with Connections" (OIDC / PKCE, zero setup). A pluggable VCS backend also supports [Lore](src/vcs/lore.ts) behind `REPOYETI_LORE=1`.

Cloud sign-in and settings sync are entirely optional and off by default; core git management works fully self-hosted and offline, no LunarWerx account required.

## More

- **AI agents (MCP):** `repoyeti mcp` exposes local repos plus accepted collaboration status/diffs and guarded remote commit+sync; the full HTTP surface is at `GET /api/openapi.json`.
- **Architecture, remote access, config:** [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Contributing & tests:** [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
